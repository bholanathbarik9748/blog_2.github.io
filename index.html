        <p class="body1"><b class="u">F</b>or five years running, Rust has taken the top spot as the most loved
            programming language. TypeScript is second surpassing Python compared to last year. We also see big gains in
            Go, moving up to 5th from 10th last year.
            <br>
            <br>
            VBA, Objective C, and Perl hold the top spots for the most dreaded languages—languages that had a high
            percentage of developers who are currently using them, but have no interest in continuing to do so.
            <br>
            <br>
            If we look at technologies that developers report that they do not use but want to learn, Python takes the
            top spot for the fourth year in a row. We also see some modest gains in the interest in learning Rust.

            Python is very famous because of its easy syntax, which is very close to the natural language. Because of
            the ease of learning, it is very much loved by beginners as well as professionals.
            <br>
            <br>
            In a StackOverflow developer survey, python is listed among the top loved programming languages.

        <br>
        <p class="body1">Not only that, Python is extensively used in machine learning. According to the StackOverflow
            developer survey 2021, the machine learning job profile is also one of the highest paying jobs in recent
            years.

            Python has excellent libraries like sci-kit learn, PyTorch, Keras, Pandas, Numpy, and many more, which makes
            machine learning very easy and fun at the same time. On top of that, Python has excellent community support
            and is supported by giants.
            So starting to learn Python would be an excellent choice for you.

    <p class="body1"><i>"Javascript is the duct tape of the Internet."</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        Charlie Campbell quoted the above line. Javascript has gained a lot of popularity in a shorter period. In the
        early 2000's big giants like Google, Microsoft started using JavaScript for the backend.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>
            What makes javascript so famous?
        </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        JavaScript allows scalability needed in cloud computing and back-end programming. It has the feature to
        communicate with other languages and communicate with databases.
    </p>
    <br>
    <img src="list2.1.png" alt="Ubuntu" class="center" width="90">

    <br>
    <p class="body1">Due to its splendid features and significant usage, javascript has maintained its top position for
        the 8th year in a row.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you are into the web development field, then javascript is of great use for you; along with HTML & CSS, you
        can develop unique projects as a beginner.
        <br>
        <br>
        With javascript language, you can develop web applications, desktop apps, server backends, and mobile apps,
        which hardly any language provides.

    <p class="body1"><i>“The apprentice avoids all use of Java classes. The journeyman embraces Java classes. The master
            knows which classes to embrace and which to avoid.”</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        We have often seen java losing its essence. However, when we look at the statistics, java is still among the
        top. It is still used by many big giants, which proves that language is always beneficial and in demand by the
        tech world.
        <br>
        <br>
        The main advantage of java is that it provides security, unlike other languages.
        <br>
        <br>
        Java runs on a virtual machine(JVM). It verifies the byte code and makes sure no unsafe operation is executed.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you want to learn android development, then java is a great language that you can look upon, and it's also an
        excellent language for a beginner to learn to program.

    <p class="body1"><i>“C++ protects against accident, not against fraud.”</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        The next programming language to learn in 2021 is everyone's favorite C/C++
        <br>
        <br>
        C/C++ is like old wine, it never loses its place, and it gets more and more demand. It's another primary
        language in need for a very long time, and it will be in the market in the future.
        <br>
        <br>
        It's a perfect language for beginners to start learning because it will help you understand computers'
        functionality. Not only that, some big firms provide a good package for c/c++ developers. As a beginner,
        learning DSA in C/C++ will be very beneficial to you.
        <br>
        <br>
        The main advantage of C/C++ is its fast execution speed compared to python. If you want better use of your
        computer resources like game development, it's a great language.
        <br>
        <br>
        And if you want to step into competitive programming, C/C++ is an excellent choice because its standard template
        library is fantastic!

        Dart was introduced on 10th October by two Google engineers at the goto conference as a new language designed to
        build web applications. It's a very young language, and it’s getting great popularity now!

        DART is a flexible language; you can use dart with flutter to make a cross-platform application that can run on
        any device: iOS and Android. Dart embraced the open-source system, which helps it to achieve excellent community
        support also. It's pretty easy to learn and can be learned as a first language. Along with the clean & concise
        syntax, it's also got more productivity with the help of an extensive collection of libraries and frameworks
        packed with it.
